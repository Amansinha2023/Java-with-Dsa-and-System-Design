Assignment Solution of Array in Java(question 1 to 6 Assignment(Day 12)

Q 1. What do you mean by an Array?
Ans  Array is the collection of same type of data(int,char,float,string)
     in the contigous memory location of the same variable.We also
     say that a subscript is called array.

Q 2. How to create an Array?
Ans  There are two ways in which we can create array
     a.By array declaration directly by the user by just specifying its
       datatype and its size inside the subscript
       example :- int a[4]={1,2,4,5};
     b.By using "new" operator because array in java is an object.
       char a[] = new char[4]
       a[0]='a';
       a[1]='m';
       a[2]='a';
       a[3]='n';
       
Q 3. Can we change the size of an array at run time?
Ans  No we cannot change the size of an array at run time because its
     once what the size has been allocated to array is fixed, and cannot
     be change.

Q 4. Can we declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
Ans  By using "new" operator we can declare an array without assigning    the size of an array because array in java is an object.
       char a[] = new char[4]
       a[0]='A';
       a[1]='M';
       a[2]='A';
       a[3]='N';

Q 5. What is the default value of Array?
Ans  The default value of Array is null in java.It also depends on the 
     datatype which is used for example if we use int datatype of the
     array the default value of the element would be zero,this varies
     across the different data types, it would be different in case
     of string.

Q 6. What is a 1 D array with an example?
Ans  The array which consist of only one subscript is called 1 D Array.
     We can also say that an array having only one row is called 1 D
     Array. example:- a[],b[5],etc.
