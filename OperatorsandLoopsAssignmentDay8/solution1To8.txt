Assignment Solution of Operators and Loops Assignment(Day 8)

Q 1. What are the Conditional Operators in java?
Ans  In java we use conditional operators when we have to generate the
     output condition between two logical conditions (mainly of the 
     conditions).
     There are three conditional operators:-
     Logical AND (&&) :- (true)&&(true) - true
                         (true)&&(true) - true
                        if both or all  the conditions are true then it
                        will only return true 
     Logical OR (||) :- (true)||(false)||(false) - true
                        if atleast one condition is true then the or 
                        operator will return true valu.
     Logical NOT (!) :- It just interchange true with f
                        false and vice versa
                        true!=false
                        false!=true
                        
Q 2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans  One the basis of operands operators are catogarized into two:-
     Unary operator: The operator which requires only single operand to
                     perform operator are called unary operator for ex-
                     unary + , unary - ,increment(++),decrement(--)
                     a++,--a,etc
     Binary operator: The operator which requires at least two operands 
                      to perform the operation is called binary operator.
                      For eg:- +,-,*,etc
                      a=a-3;
                      a-b,a*r,etc.
Q 3. What is the use of switch case in java programming?
Ans  We use switch case in java if we want to execute different cases on 
     the basis of equality.It is like an if else ladder with multiple 
     conditions, where we check for equality of variable with various 
     values. 
     If helps us to skip multiple if else statement in a program.
     
Q 4. What is the priority levels of arithmetic operations in java?
Ans  In java the priority levels of arithmetic operations in java 
     is from to left to right .For example
     int a=5;
     int c=10;
     int b=6;
     int d=90;
     int ans=a+b+c+d;
     it will execute from left to right i.e. first a+b will happen then 
     a+b+c then a+b+c+d will happen while execution .
     
Q 5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in java?
Ans  Conditional statement are the logical statement where decision is
     made whether the provided condition is true or not. For example
     a condition is given to computer(4<7) so the answer is true
     for true condition we can write a block of instruction which the 
     computer can perform , if the condition is false we can instruct 
     the computer to perform different set of instruction.
     So this give the power of decision to choose between two instruction
     execution.
     There are three types of conditional statement:-
     if(),if()else,switch statement.
     
Q 6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans  The syntax of if else statement is 
     if(condition){
              statement 1;  //If true
              }
     else{
          statement 2;    //If false
          }
          
Q 7. What are the three Types of iterative statements in java?
Ans  The three Iterative Statements in java are:-
     for() loop
     while() loop 
     do while() loop

Q 8. What are the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans  The main difference between for loop and do-while loop is that 
     for loop is an entry control loop and do-while is a exit control 
     loop,i.e condition is checked first in for loop before the execution 
     of inner command, and in do-while loop the condition is checked 
     after the command is executed once.
