     in double quotes.
     
Q 2. Types of String in Java?
Ans  In Java there are basically two types of things :-
     Immutable String:- String whose value cannot be changed if we try to
                        change its value then a new object is created in
                        the heap area.
     Mutable String:- String whose value can be changed are called 
                      mutable string.
                      
Q 3. In how many ways can you create string object in java?
And  In three ways we can create string object in java
     a.By using String class(immutable string)
     b.By using String Buffer(mutable string)
     c.By using String Builder(mutable string)
     
Q 4. What do you mean by mutable and immutable object?
And  The object whose value can be changed we it is created once inside
     the heap memory area is called mutable object.
     The object whose value cannot be created once  it is created inside
     the heap memory area is called immutable object.If try to change
     the value of object then a new object will created of that
     changed value but would not be reffered by the object.
     
Q 5. Where is exactly the String Constant Pool(SCP) located in the memory?
And  The string constant pool is located inside the heap area in the 
     in the memory.
