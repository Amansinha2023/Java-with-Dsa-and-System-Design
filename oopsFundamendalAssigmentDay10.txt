Q 1. How to create an object in java?
Ans  To create and object in java we use a primitive keyword that is 
     "new" keyword. This primitive keyword is used to create object
     in java programming language.

Q 2. What is the use of a new Keyword in Java?
Ans  The main use of new keyword is to create new object in java, when
     we use new and when it is detected by JVM it allocates a memory 
     in heap memory for the new created object execution, if happens
     in the program.

Q 3. What are the different types of variable in Java?
Ans  There are three different types of variable in java and they are
     as follows:-
     a.Static variable
     b.Instance variable (global variable in c++)
     c.Local variable .

Q 4. What is the difference between instance variable and local variable?
Ans  The main difference between instance and local variable is that
     both the variable is created inside the class but the factor which
     differentiate them is that
     Local variable is crated inside the main method or some other method
     and it's scope lies with method to which it is associated and 
     is locally available to that method only in which it is decleared.
     where as, instance variable is created outside the main method and
     is created at the time of object creation.

Q 5. In which area memory is allocated for instance and local variable?
Ans  Instance variable is allocated in Heap memory,after creation         object in stack memory where as
     local variable is allocated in stack memory,during the function call.

Q 6. What is method overloading?
Ans  Method overloading is the process in which we give same name to 
     different methods(function),but the difference is created by
     the signature(parameters) which are defined inside the function.
     parameters are differentiated on the no of parameters,datatype
     of the parameters.
