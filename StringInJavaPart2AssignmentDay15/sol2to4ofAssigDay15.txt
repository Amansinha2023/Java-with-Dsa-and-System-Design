Ans  We compare two string in java by two methods 
     a. by '==" operator(it compare the reference of the object)
     b. by equals() (it compare the content of the object)
     for example:- String s1="Aman";
                   String s2=new String("Aman");
                   System.out.println(s1==s2);     ans-false(since location was compared which is different)
                   System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  ans -true (since actual value is compared )
