Assignment of Fundamental of Java (Day 6)

Q 1. What is Programming language?
Ans  Programming language is definite set of instructions which is given
     to a machine, or computer to perform specific task.The task performed
     depends upon the kind of input or information provided by the user,
     the task of giving input is performed by given it in language that a 
     computer or machine understands.

Q 2. Why do we need a programming language?
Ans  As we know all the processing of data happen in the processor,which is 
     made of semiconductors and consist of transistors "npn" and "pnp" this
     two transistor only detects high voltage(1) and low voltage(0).So the
     only things this transistor understand  is 0 and 1.To make them do 
     work we need to instruct them in Machine level language.So in order
     to give them instruction we need a programming language and an
     intermediate which converts High level language(Programming language) 
     to low level language(0,1).
